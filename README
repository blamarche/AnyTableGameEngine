AnyTable Game Engine
--------------------

Project Goal: 
The goal of this project is to create a highly flexible, efficient way to play table-top and complete-information board games on the web. This should have no signup process needed, and support an "infinite" number of players

Initial Scope:
Custom game type builder
Pre-made game types for popular games
Password protection or sufficiently complex url to share per-game
Shared game notes / chat
Dice rolls

Potential Future Features:
View-only mode/url
Self-contained image hosting/uploading for table graphic and game pieces
Support for hidden-information games
Game history
